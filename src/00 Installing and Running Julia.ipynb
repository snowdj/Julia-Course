    "This notebook describes the installation process for various components of the software. \n",

    "### Competences\n",
    "\n",
    "The reader will be able to install `Julia` and all its components, to run `Julia` and start `IJulia`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested reading\n",

    "## Installing Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "To install and use `IJulia` you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- download and install [Anaconda](http://www.continuum.io/downloads) and follow the instructions - this installs Python (_be sure to choose version 3.5_) and most popular [Python packages](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs.html), including `IPython`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can follow the instructions on the Jupyter [Installation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Julia download andextract prebuilt binary for your operating system - see [Downloads](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have sufficient expertise, you can download the Julia source and compiling it yourself -  see [Source Download and Compilation](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/#source-download-and-compilation).\n",
    "You can also install the current Nigtly Build, but are adviced against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After instalation, you can start Julia in terminal mode by clicking its icon. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing and running `IJulia`\n",
    "\n",
    "Do the following:\n",
    "* start Julia in terminal mode\n",
    "* at the `julia` prompt type\n",
    "```\n",
    "Pkg.add(\"IJulia\")\n",
    "using IJulia\n",
    "notebook()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This opens IJulia window in your browser. (_The first two commands need to be executed only the first time!_). Semi-colon is the shell escape symbol, so, for example `; ls` gives directory listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, you can also start `IJulia` by executing command \n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "in the command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linux, packges are installed in the directory `$HOME/.julia/v0.6/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows (10), you will have Julia icon which starts Julia command window.\n",
    "Julia is installed in the directory (`AppData` is a hidden directory):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\\Users\\your_user_name\\AppData\\Local\\Julia-0.6.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "The packages are installed in a directory `\\Users\\your_user_name\\.julia\\v0.6`\n",
    "In Julia, current path and directory listing are obtained by Julia commands\n",
    "`pwd()` and `readdir()`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to executing `notebook()` command, you can use shell commands in `Julia` prompt to change directory, something like \n",
    "```\n",
    "; cd ../../my_julia_directory`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n"
