The notebooks have been updated to use the current Julia kernel Version 0.6.2.

__Welcome to the 21st+  century computation!__

To understand why to learn and use __Julia__, and to get an idea what is
it all about, read the section
[Why Julia (Julia for Numerical Computation in MIT Courses)](https://github.com/stevengj/julia-mit/blob/master/README.md#why-julia)
and Sections 1 and 2 in [Julia: A fresh approach to numerical
computing](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1607v2.pdf).

Recommended resurces for learning Julia can be found at the
[Julia Learning Page](http://julialang.org/learning/).

To understand the author's concepts behind the creation of the course,
read the [Manifest](src/Manifest.md).

## Julia's Features

* fast
* open
* profiling
* types
* mutliple dispatch (polymorphism)
* operator and function overloading
* multidimensional arrays
* packages
* writing your packages on [github](https://github.com)
* many plotting environments
* interfaces to other languages
* interfaces to software packages (like [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack))
* can be used without installing it at [JuliaBox](http://juliabox.org)
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks
* symbolic computation with [sympy](http://sympy.org/en/index.html)
* interactivity with [@manipulate](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Interact.jl)
* web accesss
* handling big data with ([HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/))
* great to use in [teaching](http://julialang.org/teaching/) and research

## What Will You Learn

Some of the above.

At the beginning of each lecture, there is a list of competences attained by the lecture.

And, the most important, Julia lets you learn and grow individually! [_(Alan Edelman)_](http://www-math.mit.edu/~edelman/index.php)

## Using the Course

Course materials are using [Julia](http://julialang.org/) programming
language and are presented as [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
The naming scheme of the notebooks is the following:

The notebooks can be used in three ways:

1. Browsing the notebooks with
[Jupyter notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) ->
[browse the notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/github.com/ivanslapnicar/Julia-Course/tree/master/src/)

2. Cloning the notebooks to your computer with the command (in Linux)

    `git clone git@github.com:ivanslapnicar/Julia-Course.git`

    For Windows, you can install the
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
and use it to clone the repository.

  The notebooks are now located in the directory `Julia-Course/src/` and
can be used interactively  - you need to install [Julia](http://julialang.org/)
and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) as described in the notebook
[Installing and Running Julia](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/github.com/ivanslapnicar/Julia-Course/tree/master/src/).

3. Executing the notebooks on [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.com/):

  * go to https://juliabox.com and sign in
  * go to __Git__
  * paste the address `https://github.com/ivanslapnicar/Julia-Course.git` into
__Git Clone URL__ box
  * check that the __Branch__ is set to _master_
  * press _+_ to add the repository
  * close the __Git__ window

  The directory `Julia-Course` is now listed. The notebooks are
  located in the directory `src/`.

### Credits

The course is based upon work of many, particular credits are given along the way. The course was started during author's visit to Julia Group at [MIT](http://www.mit./edu) under the [Fulbright-Schuman International Educator Grant](http://www.fulbrightschuman.eu/).
This version was developed for [GIAN](http://www.gian.iitkgp.ac.in/) course [_Modern Applications of Numerical Linear Algebra Methods_](https://github.com/ivanslapnicar/GIAN-NLA-Course). The material is used in Tutorials at the SoftCOM conferences [2015](http://marjan.fesb.hr/SoftCOM/2015/), [2016](http://marjan.fesb.hr/SoftCOM/2016/) and [2017](http://softcom2017.fesb.unist.hr/).
